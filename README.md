  Demetrio Alvarez Portfolio
</h1>

This website is my personal portfolio, which has been made using gatsby and the default web template.
_You can find more info about Gatsby here at the [official website](https://www.gatsbyjs.org)._

## 🚀 Do you want to use it?

1.  **Start developing.**

    Navigate into the site’s directory and start it up.

    ````shell
    gatsby develop
    ```zzzz

    ````

1.  **Open the source code and start editing!**

    Your site is now running at `http://localhost:8000`!

    _Note: You'll also see a second link: _`http://localhost:8000/___graphql`_. This is a tool you can use to experiment with querying your data. Learn more about using this tool in the [Gatsby tutorial](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/tutorial/part-five/#introducing-graphiql)._

    Open the `my-default-starter` directory in your code editor of choice and edit `src/pages/index.js`. Save your changes and the browser will update in real time!
